Main Objective: Communication amongst JavaScript and Python Files for Component Interaction

Below is an overview of the work done per day:

Day 1 
	
 	- Getting familiar with ROS
	- Installing ROS Pre-requisites (Ubuntu Linux, WSL, etc.)
		○ Installation/Ubuntu - ROS Wiki
		○ How to Use Linux Terminal in Windows 11 (allthings.how)
		○ Also, can have a virtual machine with Ubuntu running
	- Installing ROS1
		○ ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment - ROS Wiki
		
Day 2 
	
 	- Creating Workspace
 
	- Creating Python package
		○ Creating Node 1
		○ Creating Node 2
		○ Communicating amongst nodes
	
	- Creating Python pakage #2
		○ Creating Node 1 
	- Communicating amongst python packages (Node 1 from pkg1 ->  Node 1 from pkg2)

Day 3 

	- Successful communication amongst packages in different workspaces + languages
		Workspaces	Catkin_ws	Catkin_cpp_ws
		Packages	Talker_pkg	Listener_cpp
		Nodes		Talker.py	Listener.cpp
	- roscpp_tutorials/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber - ROS Wiki

	
Day 4
